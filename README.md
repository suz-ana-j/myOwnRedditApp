# My Own Hybrid Reddit App
I built this app using everything I learned so far in React and Redux, with the help of AI. I call it a hybrid app because it can feature content by both the creator and reddit users. 
# Description
* The app has an authorization code to ensure that users are not posting unrelated or inappropraite content. 
* There are several subreddit categories that users can post within. Each post has the option of likes and comments.
* I've created an over-lapping effect for larger-screens, where 2 posts in a row can overlap, and hovering over a post will make it disappear before you click on it! This same effect is not seen on smaller screens.
# Technologies Used
* Visual Studio Code
* AI 
* create-react-app
* install donetv
* authorization code using express
* react and reactDOM
* redux and redux toolkit
* useState, createSlice
* react-redux, useDispatch
## Licence
Copyright suz-ana-j MIT.  (The app should have a gitignore licence due to private code in the .env file, however I did not add this licence at the beginning and do not know how to add it in now).
